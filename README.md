===================

A conversation held in the last ten seconds of humanity, interrupted by flashbacks to a simpler time.

There is more than one ending and more than one route. There are secrets which I have tried to make easier to discover than randomly pressing keys.

About the story: don't ask. 

*Careful: Loud noises.*
